# üê® Koaloader üì•

A collection of DLLs that use search order hijacking to automatically inject specified DLLs.

[Official forum topic](https://cs.rin.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?p=2536753#p2536753)

## üöÄ Usage

Simply place one of the proxy dlls where a process is attempting to load it and setup the config file to load the DLLs
that you wish to inject.

## ‚öô Configuration

Koaloader comes with a configuration file `Koaloader.json`, which will be the same for any proxy dll. The config file
conforms to the standard JSON format. The description of each available option is presented below:

* `logging`: Enables or disables logging into a `Koaloader.log` file. Possible values: `true`, `false` (default).
* `targets`: A list of strings that specify targeted executables. Koaloader will inject modules if, and only if:
    * The list of targets is empty
    * The list of targets includes the executable that has loaded Koaloader.
* `modules`: A list of objects that describe modules that will be loaded in the order they were defined. Each object has
  the following properties:
    * `path`:  A string that specifies absolute or relative path to a DLL. The relative path is with respect to the working directory, which may be different from the executable directory.

You can refer to the following config as an example.

> * `target.dll` - via a path that is relative to the current working directory of the executable
> * `eucalyptus.dll` - via an absolute path.

>   "logging": true,
>   "targets": [ "program32.exe", "program64.exe" ],
>   "modules": [
>     {
>       "path": "target.dll"
>     },
>     {
>       "path": "C:/users/acidicoala/eucalyptus.dll"
>     }
>   ]

## üõ† Development

### üö• Prerequisites

* Git v2.13 or newer
* CMake 3.21 or newer
* Visual Studio 2022 Build Tools/IDE with "**Desktop Development with C++**" installed.

___
Clone the project with its submodules:

```powershell
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/acidicoala/Koaloader.git
```

Run the build script with desired parameters:

```shell
./build.ps1 $Arch $Config $Proxy
```

* `$Arch` - Program architecture. Valid values:
    * `32`
    * `64`
* `$Config` - Build configuration. Valid values:
    * `Debug`
    * `Release`
    * `RelWithDebInfo`
* `$Proxy` - Proxy DLL to build. Any DLL from `C:/Windows/System32 `is valid.

Example:

```shell
./build.ps1 64 Release d3d11
```

The final DLL will be located at
`build\$Arch\$Proxy\$Config`

### Potential improvements

- [ ] DLLs with unnamed exports (by ordinal)
- [ ] DLLs that are missing from System32 directory

### Miscellaneous notes

- Version is defined in [CMakeLists.txt](./CMakeLists.txt)
- CMake project likely needs to be reloaded after changing files in the [res](./res) directory.
- GitHub actions will build the project on every push to `master`, but will prepare a draft release only if the last
  commit was tagged.
- Proxy dll need to be defined in [ci.yml](.github/workflows/ci.yml)
